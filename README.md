Willow Movie Poster Emporium üçø‚ú®

What's This All About?
This project is an e-commerce application dedicated to selling high-quality movie posters from the Willow franchise. Our goal is to create a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for fans to browse, select, and purchase their favorite posters. Think of it as a treasure trove for Willow enthusiasts!

Features (What You Can Expect!)

Detailed Product Views: Get up close with high-resolution images and detailed descriptions of each poster.
Shopping Cart Functionality: Add multiple posters to your cart and manage your selections with ease.
Secure Checkout: A smooth and secure process to complete your purchases.
Admin Panel: (For us!) A powerful backend to manage products, orders, and users.


Getting Started (For Fellow Developers!)
Want to get this app up and running on your local machine? Here's how:

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have these installed:

Node.js (and npm or yarn)
MongoDB (either a local instance or access to a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
Vite (for the front-end)
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone : https://github.com/willischuks/willow-Ecommerce-app.git
cd Digital-ecommerce


## Install dependencies:

Bash

# If using npm
npm install
# Or if using yarn
yarn install

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

DATABASE_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret


## Database Setup
Create a MongoDB database. You can use a cloud solution like MongoDB Atlas (highly recommended for ease of use) or set up your own local MongoDB server.
Once your database is ready, obtain your connection string (also known as the MongoDB URI). It will look something like this: mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/mydatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority.
Add this connection string to your .env file as DATABASE_URL. Ensure your application is configured to read this environment variable for its database connection.
Running the App
Once everything is set up, you can fire up the development server:

Bash

# To run the development server
npm run dev
# Or if using yarn
yarn dev
The app should now be running locally at http://localhost:[your-port-number].
